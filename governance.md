# OpenRefine Governance Model 
Draft for discussion. Please sumbit pull request to edit this document. Major changes will be discussed in the pull request comment section

## Summary / Overview 
OpenRefine is a free, open source, powerful tool for working with messy data. OpenRefine has a plugin architecture and is distributed under the [new BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) allowing modification, distribution and name changes. 

## Roles And Responsibilities
OpenRefine development is based on user consensus and open discussion between users. Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project design and participate in the decision making process. This document describes how that participation takes place.

### Users
Users are community member who have a need for the project. Through their usage, they give the project a purpose. Users are encouraged to participate in the project life by providing feedback on how their needs are satisfied. 

Users activities include (but are not limited to):
+ evangelisation and advocating for the project
+ informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective through the [user discussion list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openrefine) and the [issue list](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues?state=open).
+ providing moral support (a ‘thank you’ goes a long way)
+ writing tutorial.

### Contributors
Contributors are users contributing in concrete ways to the project. Contribution may be a one time participation or occur over time. Contribution can take place in many ways:
+ supporting new users via the [user discussion list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openrefine)
+ submit patch to fix bugs or add features
+ identifying requirements
+ providing graphics and web design
+ writing and maintaining the [documentation](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki)

How to become an OpenRefine contributors? The [documentation for developers](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Documentation-For-Developers) is a good place to start getting familiar with the code base.  We invite contributors to share their feature development and patch idea through the [developer discussion list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openrefine-dev). It is recommended to start with small patches and share your code early so the community can provide feedback and guidance.

### Committers
Committers are contributors who have shown dedication to OpenRefine, have a deep understanding of the code base and project strategy and work well with contributors and users. Committers have no more authorities than contributors, and they should engage with the community through the [developer discussion list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openrefine-dev) regarding their intention. However committers have earn enough trust from the community to have direct access to the project code base without having to submit pull request. Committers seeks approval after the contribution is made, rather than before.
 
Therefor committers
+ help contributors via the [developer discussion list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openrefine-dev).
+ merge pull request submit by contributors
+ have direct access to the code base
+ nominate and vote new committer

Committers also participate in strategic planning, release planning, and approving changes to the governance model. 

How to become an OpenRefine Committers?  Be a contributor and be nominated as a committer. You may nominate yourself. Nomination should be sent to the [developer discussion list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openrefine-dev)


##  Decision Making Process 
### Consensus building
How does a committer know when the community agree to merge a pull request or accept his code contribution? Should we use:
+ lazy consensus ? if so, what is the time period (72h, one week?)
+ review and approval by a minimum of committers? if so how many?
+ community (contributors, committers, PMC) vote?

### Open Development process

OpenRefine development is based on user consensus and open discussion between users. Decision making must be done in a transparent, open fashion (ie. using discussion list and issue list). No decisions about the project’s direction, bug fixes or features may be done in private without community involvement and participation. Discussions must begin at the earliest possible point on a topic; the community’s participation is vital during the entire decision-making process.
