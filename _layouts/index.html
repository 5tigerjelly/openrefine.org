  <h1 id="welcome">Welcome!</h1>

<p>OpenRefine (formerly Google Refine) is a powerful tool for working with messy data: 
cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with 
web services and external data.</p>

<p>Please note that since October 2nd, 2012, Google is not actively supporting 
this project, which has now been rebranded to OpenRefine. Project development,
 documentation and promotion is now fully supported by volunteers. Find out
 more about the history of OpenRefine 
and how you can help the community.</p>
