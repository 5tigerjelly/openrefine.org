title: "Governance changes: Sandra Fauconnier steps down from project director position to focus on Wikimedia work"
---

Sandra Fauconnier has been OpenRefine's project director since February 2022, and has been working on many fronts in this capacity:Â leading a reflection on the transformation of the project's gouvernance model, running the biyearly user survey,
coordinating our participation in the Outreachy internship programme, migrating from Google Groups to our new Discourse forum, and many more project management tasks behind the scenes.
Given her close ties with the Wikimedia and Wikibase communities, she also strengthened the project's ties with those partners.

Sandra has decided to step down from the project director role to be able to fully focus on her work on the Wikimedia movement. She plans to still be involved with OpenRefine, for instance to run training workshops about the
Wikimedia Commons integration project she lead over the past year. As of December 1st, she has transfered back the general project governance responsibilities to the advisory committee, consisting of Martin Magdinier, Jan Ainali and Antonin Delpeuch.

We thank Sandra for her tireless work in this position and will follow up soon about our measures to fill the gap left by her change of position.
We also intend to continue working with the Wikimedia community to maintain and further develop the Wikibase integration in OpenRefine. We are hopeful that capacity can be built up within OpenRefine or in Wikimedia partner organizations to make this
happen.
