The results of our fourth OpenRefine user survey are out! We received 178 responses in less than four weeks (vs. 122 in 2018 over a seven month period)! The goal of the study is to keep an accurate and up to date picture of the OpenRefine community. When possible, we compared the 2020 results with our previous survey. You can view the full details of the [2012](http://googlerefine.blogspot.ca/2012/10/google-refine-usage-survey-results.html), [2014](http://openrefine.org/blog/2014/08/29/2014-survey-results.html), and [2018](http://openrefine.org/blog/2018/07/16/2018-survey-results.html) surveys

## Community you identify with

While Librarian remain the largest group (37.64%), Wikidata contributor (and sementic web - 12.92%) made an entry as a second largest user group in 2020! Researchers now ranks third with 10.7% of the user base. Note the community Archivist was not suggested in the answer but still gather 4.49% of the answer!

##  How often do you use OpenRefine

Usage frequency remains globally the same since 2012, with about a third using OpenRefine weekly, a third monthly and a third less than monthly. Note that we did not offer the option _Less than once a month_ in the 2012 survey and remove the First time user option after 2012.

## For how long have you been using OpenRefine

Users with over two years of experience keep growing years over years and now 57% of the user base (vs. 51% in 2018). We take it as a positive fact where we can keep our user base, while being able to attract new users. 

Note that in the below analysis we included users that never used OpenRefine in the less than six months group (five respondents in 2014, nine in 2018, three in 2020).

## How will you rate your skills using OpenRefine

In all our survey we asked respondents to rate their skills from one to five. One being a novice in Refine and five being a master. The number of novice respondant droped in 2020 from 16% to 7%. The skills is related to the frequency of usage more than the experience in year. No matter how long you have been using GREL, you got to practice it every day to improve !

## Version of OpenRefine

While the majority are using the latest stable version at the time of the survey (OpenRefine 3.2)

<a href="https://raw.github.com/OpenRefine/openrefine.github.com/master/images/2020survey/3.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRefine/openrefine.github.com/master/images/2020survey/3.png" class="inset" /></a>

## High-level tasks you do with OpenRefine

Usage breakdown remains stable compared to the 2012 and 2018 survey. With two notables differences: 
* Preparing data to load into another system ranks now second with over 73% of the respondant (vs. 66% in 2018)
* Now more than half of the OpenRefine user use the reconciliation feature (44% in 2018 to 54% in 2020).
* We see a net decrease in OpenRefine for data discovery (understand data you don't own) or preparing for data visualization.

## Do you use plugin or extension?

72% of the respondents do not use plugins or extension; 11% installed only one plugin and 17% of them installed more than one. Overall we see a drop in usage for many plugins.

The top three plugins are: 
* RDF extension - by DERI - 19.7%
* Named-Entity Recognition - by Ruben Verborgh (Free Your Metadata) - 13.9%
* History tools, cross cell tools, pivot tool and scatterplot tool using D3 - by VIB-BITS - 10.9%

The DBpedia extension - by Zemanta has not been updated for seven year but grew from 5.7% installation two years ago to 10.9% in 2020. The user is not linked to any particular community (6 librarian, 3 for profit, 2 archivist, and one for cultural heritage, data scientist, researcher and wikidata contributor). Any explaination is welcome!

Note: Respondent can select multiple answers. We consolidated the 41 blank answer with I don't use plugin or extension. Click on the image to enlarge it. 

## Do you use a reconciliation service?

Usage of reconciliation services is the nice and big surprise of this survey! In 2020, close to 65% of OpenRefine users connect to a reconciliation service! This is a huge progress from 48% two years ago! 26.52% of the respondents use more than one service versus 18.03% in 2018. 

While Wikidata(45%) and VIAF (22%) dominate the list, we see new services not listed in 2018:
* GND (six respondants)
* Getty Vocabularies (three respondants)
* in-house reconciliation service (three respondant)
* Open LIbrary (one respondant)
* ORCID (one respondant)
* Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (one respondant)
* Planning to use with Linked Data Finland's datasets (one respondant)
* Sharedshelf Built Work Registry Reconciliation Service (one respondant)
* SNAC (one respondant)
* Nomisma (one respondant)

## Perception of Refine: 

The following word clouds are more eye-pleasing than an in-depth analysis.

### Why did you choose OpenRefine (Which features)

Wikida makes an nice entry! 

<a href="https://raw.github.com/OpenRefine/openrefine.github.com/master/images/2020survey/reason.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRefine/openrefine.github.com/master/images/2020survey/reason.png" class="inset" /></a>

### Alternative tools

Excel, R, python and Google Sheets remain the mains alternative to OpenRefine.

### Word used to describe OpenRefine

The most common expression are "Excel on steroid" and "a data cleaning tool"

### From the Feature Request and Anything to add

We compiled below suggestions and feature requests submitted via the survey. 

## Features Request


* Improve performance and support larger dataset  (7 requests) - this is on the 2020 roadmap and under development on the 4.x branch!
* Better UX (6 requests)
* Online support with user login and permission (4 requests)
* Make regex expression easier to build (4 requests)
* Is easier install potentially with a standalone java (4 requests)
* List in OpenRefine all plugins available (4 requests) 
* List in OpenRefine all the reconciliation service available (3 requests)
* Better support for hierarchical data (2 requests)
* Allow to memory from the front end (2 requests)
* Would let me choose where I can store my files!
* Have real Title Case transforms that left articles like A, An, And, The lowercased as well as prepositions instead of capitalizing each word.
* Add row to a project
* Support POST request
* Ability to save facet
* Allow extension to be written in python. 

## Wiki Data Related

* Support editing and uploading to  Structured Data on Commons (https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/2144), and external Wikibases (2 requests)
* Better error handling when uploading to Wikidata (2 requests)
* Had improved Wikidata integration, particularly more control over modifying existing statements including qualifiers and references
* Support wikicode
* Build automated Wikidata ingest pipelines

## Improve History

From three different requests. 

A couple of request to allow an easier way to edit/tweak operation history (i.e. adjust an edit made multiple steps ago without losing subsequent steps). It would be nice if cell provenance could be accessible programmatically or via the interface. So for instance in terms of rewinding to a certain state, it would be nice to know at what step a cell/row/column last changed, or what the previous state of the cell/row/column was, or what the state was at a particular step.

## Plugin to support in core


* RDF (6 requests)
*csv reconvile (5 requests). It is requested in [#2003](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/2003) and part of [Google Summer of Code 2020 proposal](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GSoC-2020%C2%A0Ideas#reconciliation-server-within-openrefine)
* Vib-bits (3 requests)
* NER (3 requests)

## Training 

* Make OpenRefine better known (5 requests)
* Make GREL more accessible. Possibly with more contextual help or a GREL-formula builder (3 requests)
* Provide more documentation on how to use reconciliation services and the different plugins (3 requests)
* Improve the onboarding.
* Provide more workshop / training on OpenRefine
