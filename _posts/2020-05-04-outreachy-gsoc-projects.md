We are happy to announce that three interns will join the development team this summer:

* Ekta Mishra ([@darecoder1999](https://github.com/darecoder1999)), our Outreachy intern, will work on improving the quality assurance features of the Wikidata integration, by adding support for new Wikidata constraints and improving the existing
  functionality;

* Lisa Chandra ([@lisa761](https://github.com/lisa761)), Google Summer of Code intern, will improve our grid view by adding support for infinite scrolling (displaying the entire grid without the need to browse it by small pages);

* Lu Liu ([@afkbrb](https://github.com/afkbrb)), Google Summer of Code intern, will add support for OAuth and other Wikibase instances in the Wikidata extension.

We are very excited to welcome them to the team and are looking forward to working with them.
We thank all applicants for the quality of their proposals and their contributions to the project earlier this year.
