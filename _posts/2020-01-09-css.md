As announced in the previous post, the OpenRefine project has joined [Code for Science and Society](https://codeforscience.org/) as a Sponsored Project.
We are thrilled to join this new home, which will help the project grow on the long term and set its openness in stone.

This is the occasion for us to improve our gouvernance model, with the creation of two committees.
The advisory committee runs the project on a day to day basis and is composed of Martin Magdinier, Thad Guidry and Antonin Delpeuch.
The steering committee oversees the general direction of the project and initates links with other organizations and projects. We
are proud of our all-star line up for this steering committee, in alphabetical order:

* Chris Erdmann (University of North Carolina, RENCI)

* Alicia Fagerving (Wikimedia Sverige)

* Sandra Fauconnier (Wikimedia Foundation)

* Simon Rogers (Google News Initiative)

* Lozana Rossenova (Rhizome)

* Juliane Schneider (Harvard Catalyst | Clinical and Translational Science Center)

* Wesley Sherperd (Unifyd Insights)

* Ruben Verborgh (University of Ghent)

* Fabio Tacchelli (Siren Solutions)

Thank you all for joining us in this exciting adventure!
