We are pleased to announce that the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com) (CZI) has awarded OpenRefine a $200,000 grant to fund its development in 2020.
This award is part of CZIâ€™s [Essential Open Source Software for Science program](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals) which awarded $5 million to over 40 projects.

This grant will be used towards two main objectives:
- grow the community of OpenRefine contributors by reaching out to seasoned users and helping them get involved more closely in the project.
- revamp the core architecture of the tool to handle larger datasets and improve workflows.

[Owen Stephens](http://www.meanboyfriend.com/overdue_ideas/) and [Antonin Delpeuch](http://antonin.delpeuch.eu/) will be hired to work towards these goals, with the help of additional contractors for specific subtasks.
For more details about our plans, see our [grant proposal](https://raw.github.com/OpenRefine/openrefine.github.com/master/images/czi-eoss-proposal.pdf).
