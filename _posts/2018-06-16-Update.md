* Documentation improvement on [our wiki](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki);

OpenRefine 3.0 is under beta, and we still have few bugs. If you want to use it please backup your workspace directory before installing and report any problems that you encounter.

### New Logo

Google News Initiation helped to design a new logo for OpenRefine. You may have noticed the new logo on our [GitHub project](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine). We made it part of the 3.0 release, and we will update it on the website with the deployment of the new website layout in the coming weeks.

## Google News Initiative Support

<a href="https://raw.github.com/OpenRefine/openrefine.github.com/master/images/2018-06-Update/Google_NewsInitiative_Lockup_FullColor.svg"><img src="/images/2018-06-Update/Google_NewsInitiative_Lockup_FullColor.svg" class="inset" /></a>

In December 2017, [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/about) offered USD 100,000 to support the development of OpenRefine as described in the document [Phase 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UwoT1nFk9zwqSlH8rmqKPmiLS2Liw7-KM5HTKD2VVi8/edit#heading=h.z6ne0og04bp5) and [Phase 2+3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lK3LT9Llwxqv4NFSQO33UX-P3vD1MzYefv6YCtf6HHk/edit#heading=h.z6ne0og04bp5). So far the funds have been used to finance the release of OpenRefine 2.8 and 3.0 (over 150 issues closed!) and covers expenses to present OpenRefine at the [NICAR 18](https://www.ire.org/conferences/nicar18/) and [IRE 18](https://ire.org/conferences/ire-2018/) conferences.

## Governance

The [OpenRefine core team](https://github.com/orgs/OpenRefine/people) is currently managing the funds via a private US company. While it was helpful to get the relationship with Google News Initiative up and running quickly, we know that this situation is not viable in the long term and we are currently under discussion to join [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/).

As we move with Software Freedom Conservancy, we will clarify and formalized our governance model. In the meanwhile, we welcome anyone feedbacks and comments via our GitHub project or our [user](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openrefine) and [developer](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openrefine-dev) mailing lists. If you like to request financing for the development of a feature, the attendance or the organization of an event, please reach out via one of our mailing lists.

You can review the usage of the fund is available in the following [Finance document.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hldPOw8W_TGM2DuKWbkFX-rexkQiE5esluZ8buadao/)


## OpenRefine road map

With the remaining funds available from Google News Initiative, we plan to address the tight coupling between the front and back end and set up the foundation for the next phases. The current implementation presents technical barriers for new contributors to engage with the community and limits the attractiveness of OpenRefine for developers. 

Currently, all OpenRefine contributors are working on the project on the top of their other academics, professionals and family commitments. While the Google funds help us to free some extra time to support OpenRefine, it is not enough to address coming milestones. We plan to hire fellow(s) / contractor(s) to work with the community and take the lead on the three following items (we will share more information regarding the fellow/contractor positions). 

You can track the next phase in the Github project [separation of Front End and Back End](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/projects/5).

### Prepare Front / Back-end separation

Our goal is to have a full API exposing all OpenRefine operation and commands. This first phase focuses solely on documenting OpenRefine operations and commands available and designing the different API endpoints. The idea is to start small and grow API over time by allowing for extensibility. In the process, we will take into account existing extension developed for OpenRefine and support backward compatibility as much as we can.

### Datagrid Enhancements
A faster grid technology with virtual DOM will set the foundation for faster scrolling, and interactive elements like drag and drop column moving and resizing, and column and row grouping to better support record mode (see the dedicated GitHub project for [UI Improvements](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/projects/2). During the implementation, we can remove the custom bits of the frontend that are coupled directly to the back-end. The new datagrid implementation is tracked via [#1347](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/1347).

### Data Storage Enhancements

The group is looking at using Apache Arrow to improve in-memory data model. An alternative, higher performance in-memory / on-disk data storage technology will help increasing OpenRefineâ€™s data processing capacity. The implementation of Apache Arrow is tracked in [#1469](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/1469) and can be done independently from the API and datagrid implementation. 


### Following Phases

Following the completion of the three previous phase, we want to: 
* Implement the new API;
* Leverage the new API and datagrid to move away from Jquery-based components and using React or Angular;
* Ensure that we have extendable API points for our most important components;
* Thanks to the decoupling of the front and back, we can answer the numerous request from the community to support new data processing engine like Apache Spark or Google DataFlow / DataProc. Those items are tracked in the project [Performance Improvements](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/projects/1);
* Keep supporting new features from the community;
